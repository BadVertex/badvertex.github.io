Sun, beer, volleyball, travel, bathing, swimming, longboarding, and of course... programming!

It is the time of year when I have the time to dedicate time to some personal projects. Today has been a long day of coding and the result was a JavaScript Ascii Art Generator. I have been doing some image manipulation using HTML5 recently and this was simply a natural next step. The image above shows the result from a render i did.

The applications is stand alone and can handle most images, although images with a lot of contrast seems to work the best. The current version works well, but I might want to tweak it at a later point to get be able to handle darker images better.

If you want to give it a try, you can find it at the <a href="https://github.com/Nexcius/AsciiArtGenerator" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>.

I have also got myself a longboard. It is much easier to start out with than I would have thought and it is so much fun! The thought is to use it as a means of transport, but at my current skill level I am most like better off simply walking.
