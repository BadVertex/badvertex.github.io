So I’m safely back from the Netherlands and the Games4Health conference. It was a very interesting getting to meet the people that are making a better tomorrow. It was a mix of game developers, designers, medical doctors, economists and business people. I got to speak to many other game students from the Netherlands as well as lecturers from Brazil to the UK.

There was a lot of games presented: games to make people move, public play games and health awareness games. Two of the most interesting presentations were Adam Lobel who presented his findings on the correlation between handling stress in video games and handling stress in real life. The other one was Kynan Eng, treating stroke patients using virtual reality.

It was a good thing that the medical professionals got to meet game developers though, considering statements like: _“We don’t play games, but we can develop them.”_
