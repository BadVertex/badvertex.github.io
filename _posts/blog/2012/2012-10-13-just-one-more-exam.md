Finished my exam in Micro-controller system design today, this means that there is only one left: Software architecture on Saturday. Really looking forward to going home now as it has been a hard semester and finally getting some time off. The project I mentioned, using Phonegap should be hitting the AppStore any day now, the only thing remaining is moving the server content (so I will rather link it when it has moved to a better server).

In the meantime, here is the final project that we did in MikSys. When recording this, the sound was not implemented yet as we were still putting it all together, but bothe the game and the drivers worked like a charm when we were done!
