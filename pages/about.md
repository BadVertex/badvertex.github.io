Bad Vertex is a blog about all things tech. Primarily you'll find programming articles, tutorials and how-tos mixed in with the odd game review or tech news. The content is maintained and primarily written by [Håvard Kindem](https://havardkindem.com){:target="_blank"}, a game developer and programmer who dabbles in a multitude of languages and technologies.

This site is a continuation of [nexcius.net](https://nexcius.net){:target="_blank"} where the earliest of the articles originate. 

As a software engineer, I strongly believe in open-source and try to share as much as possible. My belief originates in sharing code in order to help others learn and to invite others to contribute. All code, images and content, including the site source itself are hereby provided under the MIT License unless otherwise noted. You may copy, modify, publish and distribute with the proper attribution.<br /><br />
