Bad Vertex is a blog about all things tech. Primarily you'll find programming articles, tutorials and how-tos mixed in with the odd game review or tech news. The content is maintained and primarily written by [HÃ¥vard Kindem](https://havardkindem.com){:target="_blank"}, a game developer and programmer who dabbles in a multitude of languages and technologies.

This site is a continuation of [nexcius.net](https://nexcius.net){:target="_blank"} where the earliest of the articles originate. 

As a software engineer, I strongly believe in open-source and try to share as much as possible. My belief originates in sharing code in order to help others learn and to invite others to contribute. All code on this site is published under the [MIT License](/license/) unless otherwise specified.
