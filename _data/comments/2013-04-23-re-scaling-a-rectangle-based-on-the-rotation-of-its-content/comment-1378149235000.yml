  Hi Marcus, thank you for noticing! I should actually have omitted that, as it
  is part of an older version of the code where the corners were calculated by
  using an interpolation-like expression instead. It worked, but was not very
  intuitive and had performed a little worse if I remember correctly. If you are
  interested, I can hook you up with the code. I'll get this post cleaned up
  shortly. Thanks again ;)
