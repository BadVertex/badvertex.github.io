message: "Thank you. By the the way I think that the line (in texcoord loading):\r\n\r\nglVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, NULL);\r\n\r\nshould look more like that:\r\n\r\nglVertexAttribPointer(1, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, NULL);\r\n\r\nBecause you are passing to shader only 2 floats not 3. It took me awhile (and lot of weird stuff on my screen :) ) to figure that out ;)"
