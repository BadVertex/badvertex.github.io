message: "Very helpful code but perhaps someone could help me resolve an error when using with assimp-3.1.-win-binaries. \r\nCode compiles but gives runtime error; \"The program can't start because assimp.exe is missing from your computer.\"  \r\nThe assimp.dll file is in the same folder as the program executable."
