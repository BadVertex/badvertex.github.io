  Greetings Skirrah. What version of Assimp are you using? As I have understood,
  there is a problem with the 3.1(.1) version of the Windows binaries. Until the
  issue is fixed, I would recommend that you downgrade your version of Assimp.
  The bug has been reported to the Github repo, you can keep up with the status
  of it here: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/302
