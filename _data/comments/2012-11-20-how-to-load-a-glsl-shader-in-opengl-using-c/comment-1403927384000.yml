message: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nJust wanted to let you know that in using this today I was getting out of bounds errors. I found that when you check errors on the fragment and vertex shaders, it doesn't check if logLength is less than one like you did after linking the program. I changed the lines to:\r\n\r\nstd::vector vertShaderError((logLength &gt; 1) ? logLength : 1);\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nstd::vector fragShaderError((logLength &gt; 1) ? logLength : 1);\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
